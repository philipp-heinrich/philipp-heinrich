# Hej 👋. 
I'm Philipp Heinrich, a Data Guy from Hamburg.  <br> 
I do all things related to data and cloud ☁️ Currently, I'm working as a Senior Cloud Data Architect [@doit.com](https://app.doit.com/)  <br>
Very much into coffee ☕ and cycling, occasional runner. <br> 

I'm always looking for the best coffee in town:
